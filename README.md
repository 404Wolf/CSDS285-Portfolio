# Linux Scripting & Tools (CSDS285) Portfolio

This is a monorepo containing various projects I worked on throughout the semester in CSDS285. Each project is containerized in a folder, with a `README.md` that briefly discuses the purpose of the project, and other notes about it and the tools that were used.
