# Room Finder UI

A (unrelated to this course) project that I've been working on in my freetime is a CWRU empty classroom finding API that uses Case's reservation system's internal API. Getting the auth to work was really challenging, but the API itself was not that hard to reverse engineer.

This is a simple one file `html` script that lets you use the API to find rooms that are unbooked at a specific time.
